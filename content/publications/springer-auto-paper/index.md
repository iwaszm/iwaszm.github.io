Before **highly automated vehicles (HAVs)** become part of everyday traffic, their **safety must be proven**.  
The use of **human performance as a benchmark** represents a promising approach - yet, appropriate methods to **quantify and compare human and HAV performance** remain rare.

---

By adapting the *method of constant stimuli*, a **scenario-based approach** to quantify the **limit of human performance** is developed.  
This method is applied in a **driving simulator study**, where participants repeatedly face a **cut-in manoeuvre** on a highway.

By systematically manipulating the **criticality** of the manoeuvre - defined in terms of *time to collision (TTC)* - humans’ **collision-avoidance performance** can be measured.

---

### Key Method
- The **limit of human performance** is identified using **logistic regression**.  
- The **regression curve** and its **inflection point** allow direct comparison between **human** and **HAV** performance.

---

### Conclusion
The presented approach provides a practical means by which **HAVs’ safety performance** can be evaluated and proven against **human driving capabilities**.
