Nowadays, **vehicle assistance systems** may assess the risks of the traffic situation with the help of advanced sensor technology and optimized algorithms.  
However, the **passengers’ feelings of risk** in the vehicle have been mostly neglected.

---

According to the *Component Process Model of emotions*, during the feeling of risk, **novelty** is one of the relevant event appraisals leading to particular **physiological and facial responses**.

To identify whether indicators for **novelty appraisal** may be used for detecting the **feeling of risk of vehicle occupants**, we investigated **physiological responses** and **facial expressions** of individuals experiencing the feeling of risk with different levels of novelty.

---

### Key Findings
This secondary analysis of an earlier simulator study revealed that:

- **Pupil diameter amplitude**  
- **Skin conductance level (SCL) changes**  
- **Facial expression activity** (inner and outer brow raiser, brow lowerer, upper lid raiser, and lid tightener)  

were **correlated with the reduction in novelty**, suggesting that these indicators could reflect the *novelty appraisal* of the feeling of risk in vehicle occupants.

---

Hence, this research provides **evidence for the novelty appraisal** of the feeling of risk.  
Furthermore, it informs research on **affect-aware systems**, which aim to identify and reduce passengers’ feelings of risk - ultimately helping to **maintain trust in automated vehicles**.
