<div class="text-base text-justify">

The integration of **autonomous driving** into **mixed traffic environments** poses unique challenges - particularly at **unsignalized intersections**, where **communication and cooperation** with human road users are essential.  

This study addresses a **critical research gap** by investigating the adherence to the **“priority-to-the-right”** rule at an urban unsignalized intersection, comparing behavioral patterns of **cyclists** and **motorists**.

---

### Study Design
Using **stationary mounted cameras**, a **12-day field observation** was conducted at an urban *T-intersection* in **Braunschweig, Germany**.  
The **class**, **trajectory**, and **scenario** of road users were identified.  
In **202 interaction cases**, vehicles from the right (*ego*, with priority) encountered vehicles or bicycles from the left (*foe*, without priority).

---

### Analysis
The study examined how:
- **Ego’s direction**,  
- **Foe’s class and lateral position**, and  
- **Relative arrival time**

influenced the **passing order**, using **descriptive statistics** and **logistic regression**.

---

### Key Findings
- **Cyclists** violated the “priority-to-the-right” rule **more frequently** than motorists.  
- Road users **with priority** were **more likely to yield** when:
  - turning right,  
  - arriving **later** at the intersection, or  
  - facing an opposing road user **close to the lane center**.  

---

### Conclusion
This study underscores the **importance of implicit communication** in mixed traffic.  
It provides **empirical benchmarks** for designing **human-like autonomous driving systems** - systems capable of **interpreting and responding** to nuanced road-user interactions at **unsignalized intersections**.
