### Background
Do cyclists disregard traffic rules more often than motorists? Answering this is essential for optimizing traffic **safety and efficiency** as we transition toward autonomous driving in mixed environments. Grounded in naturalistic observations at urban unsignalized intersections, our study utilizes **quasi-experimental methods** and **regression analysis** to quantify compliance behaviors. This research is the result of a seamless collaboration between project managers, sensor technicians, data engineers, and human factors researchers, aiming to provide the critical behavioral data needed for safe human-machine coexistence.

### Methods
Using stationary cameras, a 12-day naturalistic traffic observation was conducted at an urban T-intersection in _Braunschweig, Germany_. The video footage underwent spatial calibration to establish a real-world coordinate system. Road users were detected and classified, and their movements were converted into georeferenced trajectories. In **202** interaction cases, a car from the right (Ego, with priority) encountered a car or a bike from the left (Foe, without priority). The study examined how the following factors associated with the **violation** using logistic regression:

- Ego's turning direction (left vs. right)
- Foe's type (car vs. bike)
- Relative arrival time
- Foe's lateral position

### Key Findings
- Cyclists violated the “priority-to-the-right” rule more frequently than motorists.  
- Road users with priority were more likely to yield when:
  - turning right
  - facing a bike
  - arriving later at the intersection
  - facing a road user **close to the lane center**


---

### Conclusion
This study underscores the importance of implicit communication in mixed traffic. It provides empirical benchmarks for designing human-like autonomous driving systems, which is supposed to be capable of interpreting and responding to nuanced road-user interactions at unsignalized intersections.
