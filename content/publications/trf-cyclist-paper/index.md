abstract: The integration of autonomous driving into mixed traffic environments poses unique challenges, especially at unsignalized intersections where communication and cooperation with human road users is necessary. This study addresses a critical research gap by investigating the adherence to the “priority-to-the-right” rule at an urban unsignalized intersection, comparing behavioral patterns of cyclists and motorists. Utilizing stationary mounted cameras, a 12-day traffic observation of an urban T-intersection in Braunschweig, Germany, was conducted. The class and the trajectory of road users as well as their scenarios were identified. In 202 cases, cars appearing from the right (ego, with priority) encountered cars or bikes coming from the left (foe, without priority). The study analyzed the impact of variables, ego’s direction, foe’s class and lateral position and their arrival time on their passing order through descriptive statistics and logistic regression. The findings reveal that cyclists disregard the “priority-to-the-right” rule more often than motorists. Additionally, road users who have the priority are more likely to yield when turning right, arriving at the intersection later, and encountering an opposing road user who is close to the center of the road. This study highlights the importance of implicit communication in traffic and provides essential benchmarks for developing more human-like autonomous driving systems, capable of interpreting and responding to nuanced road user interactions at unsignalized intersections.

summary: Cooperative behaviors among road users, such as predicting and compensating for another road user’s mistakes, were investigated.
